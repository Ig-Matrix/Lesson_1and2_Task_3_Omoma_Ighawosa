                Follow me as I recount my time serving as a Corp Member in Awka,
                Anambra State.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Experiences were majorly in <em>Teaching</em>,
                <em>CDS Leadership</em> and <em>I4GxZuri Training.</em>

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>
                    I served in a popular secondary school in Umuokpu.The name
                    of the school is
                    <strong>Community Secondary School, Umuopkpu. </strong>I was
                    assigned to the Physics department.The classes I taught were
                    <strong>SS1</strong> and <strong>SS2</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My activitie as a teacher were in two fold which were
                    <em>explanations</em>and <em>Marking Scripts</em>
                </p>
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>
                    I took time explaining the topics to the students. Most of
                    them had poor science backgrounds and I had to utilize
                    several examples and visible illustrations to preach the
                    Gospel of Physics to them. I entertained questions and also
                    asked them questions aimed at sharpening their minds and
                    improving their cognitive abilities. Initially, it was one
                    sided with me doing the all the talking but as time went and
                    I piqued their interest, they began to follow along well. I
                    really relished this aspect of the job.
                </p>
                <h3>Marking Scripts</h3>
                <p>
                    I must admit I didn't enjoy this part of the job. I tught
                    the full arm of SS1 and there were 6 arms with each arm
                    having an estimate of 50 students. This left me with the
                    humongous task of marking and recording the scripts of
                    <strong> 300 students</strong> every time they wrote tests
                    and exams or had a project. Over time, I learnt some hacks
                    and with the help of my HOD, I was able to acclamatize well.

                <h2>CDS</h2>
                <p>
                    CDS stands for<strong>Community Development Service </strong>, 
                    and it is an integral part of the National Youth Service
                    Corps (NYSC) program in Nigeria. During the service year,
                    all corps members are expected to participate in CDS
                    activities aimed at improving the host community's
                    socioeconomic development. CDS groups are formed based on
                    corps members' interests and skills, and they work together
                    on various projects such as education, health, environment,
                    agriculture, and entrepreneurship. CDS programmeis a vital
                    component of the NYSC scheme. It provides a platform for
                    Corps Members to contribute to the development of their host
                    communities while also developing their skills and improving
                    their employability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my service year, I belonged to the
                    <em>Digital Onboarders</em> CDS group and served as the
                    President.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major activities carried out by the CDS are Google my
                    Business(GMB) profiling and Digital skills sensitizations
                </p>
                <h3>Google my Business(GMB) Profiling</h3>
                <p>
                    Google My Business (GMB) profiling is the process of
                    creating and managing a free online business listing on
                    Google. GMB is a tool provided by Google that enables
                    businesses to manage their online presence on Google Search
                    and Google Maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With GMB profiling, businesses can provide important
                    information to potential customers, including their business
                    name, address, phone number, website, business hours,
                    photos, and reviews. This information is displayed
                    prominently on Google Search and Maps, making it easier for
                    customers to find and contact the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my tenure, we profiled over 400 businesses on Google.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital Skills Sensitization</h3>
                <p>
                    Digital skills sensitization refers to the process of
                    increasing awareness and understanding of digital
                    technologies and their potential benefits, as well as
                    promoting the development of digital skills among
                    individuals or organizations. It involves educating people
                    on the importance of digital literacy and equipping them
                    with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively use
                    digital tools and technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my tenure, we target Students and Youths in our local
                    community and carried out intensive sensitizations. I even
                    organised a Mega Digital Conference in Awka.

                <h2>I4GxZuri Training.</h2>
                <p>
                    The I4GxZuri Training was an intensive 3 months internship
                    on fullstack development. It was this training the
                    kickstarted my career as a Software Developer. The
                    technologies covered included HTML, CSS and Javascript for
                    Frontend and Django, Python for Backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The training was in two parts; Front end web development and
                    Backend Web development
                </p>
                <h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    During the front end training, I learnt how to build simple
                    responsive websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript I learnt
                    correct syntax and usage of elements, properties and
                    functions in the various technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, I learnt how to use the pre tag in html. Unlike
                    the p tag, the pre tag is used to display text exactly as it
                    appears in the HTML code. When the pre tag is used , any
                    whitespace characters (like spaces and line breaks) within
                    the tag's content will be displayed as they are, without
                    collapsing. This is illustrated below:
                </p>
                <pre>
                        I love programming 
                        I want to be the best Software Developer there is.
                </pre>
                <h3>Back End Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    The back end training was not as intensive as the Frontend
                    but it was very interesting nonetheless. I learnt the basics
                    of Python programming. I still recall vividly my first block
                    of code in Python:
                </p>
                <code
                    >print("Hello, World!") # This line of code will print
                    "Hello, World!"
                </code>
                <p>
                    At the end, I learnt a lot and was able to build simple web
                    applications using the DJango CRUD.
                </p>
            </article>
            <p>
                Overall, my service year was very fulfilling. I have accumulated
                numerous experiences that I aspire to learn from, and use as
                motivation to accomplish even greater things. As Aldous Huxley
                said:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Experience is not what happens to you; it's what you do with
                what happens to you."
